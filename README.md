### **1. Project Aim**
The objective of this project was to analyze crop production data from Kenya using the Kenya_Crops_Dataset and develop a dynamic dashboard to visualize key agricultural metrics. The project aimed to provide insights into crop yields, revenue generation, and seasonal trends by leveraging data cleaning, pivot tables, and interactive visualizations.

### **2. Data Preparation & Cleaning**
The dataset contained critical information about crops, including:

- Crop Name (e.g., Maize, Beans, Sorghum)
- Region (e.g., Eldoret, Kericho, Kiambu)
- Season (Dry Season, Long Rains, Short Rains)
- Year (2023, 2024)
- Yield (Tons) – Amount of crop harvested
- Revenue (KES) – Income generated from the crop
- Cost (KES) – Expenses incurred in production

Before analysis, the following data cleaning steps were undertaken:

- Checked for missing values and replaced blanks, errors, and N/A entries.
- Formatted numerical data correctly (e.g., ensuring yield and revenue values were consistent).
- Removed duplicates to maintain dataset integrity.
- Created a clean version of the dataset for accurate reporting.

### **3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
The following KPIs were calculated and displayed on the dashboard:

**Total Revenue: KES 1,005,974,000.88**
This metric represents the sum of all revenues generated across regions and seasons.

**Average Yield per Season: 2.64 Tons**
This value was derived from the total yield divided by the number of recorded seasons.

**Highest Revenue Crop: Sorghum**
Among all crops, Sorghum generated the highest revenue, making it the most profitable crop.

### **4. Data Analysis & Observations**
### Revenue Trends
The Total Revenue Per Year chart indicates a significant revenue decline from 2023 to 2024.
The highest revenue-generating crop was Sorghum, indicating its strong market value or high yield.
### Yield Performance by Region
The Total Yield by Region bar chart reveals that Nyeri recorded the highest crop yield, while other regions, such as Eldoret and Kiambu, had moderate yields.
This disparity in yield across regions may be due to differences in climate conditions, soil fertility, or farming techniques.
### Revenue Distribution by Crop Type
The pie chart visualizing total revenue by crop type shows that revenue is well-distributed among multiple crops, but a few crops (e.g., Sorghum, Rice, and Tea) dominate the earnings.

---
### **5. Dashboard Features & Functionality**
The dashboard was designed to be interactive including:

- Slicers for filtering data by Region, Season, and Year to enable dynamic analysis.
- Pivot Tables summarizing:
- Yield distribution by region and season.
- Revenue contribution by crop type.

Visualizations:
- Bar Chart: Showcasing yield by region.
- Pie Chart: Displaying revenue share per crop.
- Line Chart: Showing revenue trends over time.
  
Additionally, summary cards were included to highlight:

- Total Revenue
- Average Yield
- Top Revenue Crop
